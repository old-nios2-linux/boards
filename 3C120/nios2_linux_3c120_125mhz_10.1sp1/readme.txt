To build this example project, make sure you have the Altera 10.1sp1 tools installed and then run the script found at build_scripts/create-this-project.sh.

The create-this-project.sh build script should be run from a bash command line, on linux this should be easily acquired, and on Windows you can launch the Nios II Command Shell to acquire a cygwin bash prompt to run this script.

The create-this-project.sh build script references a number of other utility scripts and source documents to complete the build process.  For more information on what these scripts do and how they do it, please read the scripts.
